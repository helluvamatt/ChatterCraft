This is a plugin for Bukkit. It enables location tracking of users and chatting with users based on a REST based protocol. It is based on a basic concept and some code from:

Minequery v1.2
http://forum.hey0.net/showthread.php?tid=2983

Install by added the JAR file to your plugins directory

You can access the server by connecting a socket to the port defined in the chattercraft.properties file. (Default is 25566) Once the socket is connected, write a basic string to the socket followed by a newline character. (\n) The string should be one of the following:

LOGIN <name of chat user>:<unique id>
CHATTER <name of chat user>:<unique id>:<message>
QUERY_XML <name of chat user>:<unique id>:<timestamp of last request>

<unique id> is a Unique identifing string for each user. Typically the PHP REMOTE_ADDR will suffice.
<timestamp of last request> should be the number returned from the last request; QUERY will give this value

Sending the newline charachter (\n) will dump valid XML for the response and immediately terminate the connection.

Minequery compatibility is mantained with the following commands:
QUERY
QUERY_JSON 

PLEASE NOTE:
I wrote this plugin specifically for my own use and am releasing it so other users can benefit from it. However, due to the fact that I am a full time college student, I can not and WILL NOT support this plugin. If something is broken, I can fix it (because that mean my copy for my server is broken as well). This will be subject to when I have time for it! I have included a PHP script that I use for my website, and I believe it a good idea to hide the plugin's server behind a firewall and use the PHP script to interface with the server. The PHP script is also GPL.
